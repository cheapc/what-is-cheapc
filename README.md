# What is cheapc?
cheapc is a Canadian business that sells PCs (custom-built or off-the-shelf) and software. The software is free and opensource, but if you buy a license you get pre-built `pyinstaller` binaries and prioritized bug reports and feature requests, to support it. (You can also vote on which features are prioritized) There is also an app called [INSERTNAMEHERE] that is currently $[14.99, maybe change????] and proprietary, but if we reach a fundinggoal of $[TBA]/mo and $[TBA] in total the price on app stores will go down to $[9.99, change if needed] and get Open Source.

# Why are you "in a black hole"?
Well, cheapc hasn't actually been started yet (sheepish shrug) but it will be. Hopefully while I keep studying, I'll have it as a small pet project, selling it online. But then I can actually get a location physically and some employees.

# cheapc's mission
Making the world a better place.
