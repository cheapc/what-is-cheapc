# What is cheapc?
cheapc is a Canadian not-for-profit that sells PCs (custom-built or off-the-shelf) and software. The software is free and opensource, but if you buy a license you get pre-built `pyinstaller` binaries and prioritized bug reports and feature requests, to support it.

# Why are you "in a black hole"?
Well, cheapc hasn't actually been started yet (sheepish shrug) but it will be. Hopefully while I keep studying, I'll have it as a small pet project, selling it online. But then I can actually get a location physically and some employees.

# cheapc's mission
Making the world a better place.
